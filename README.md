# Programming and Scripting Weekly Tasks

## Weekly Task 02

Creation of program called bank.py which adds 2 amounts entered by the user, and prints out the answer in readable euro and cent format

### Comments

Once I understood to specify the inputs as integers, the code was easy to create. I did however, notice an issue when the final figure would end with a zero as it wouldn't be display (€2.5 rather than €2.50). I did find the solution on the below link, and was able to specify the total value be displayed with 2 decimal places at all times.

Finally, to make the output more legible, I added empty lines using print()
